## Overview

This is an e-commerce product page with carousel, modal and cart features. The project was build with Tailwind, React.js and TypeScript. For state managemenet I used React Toolkit and React Context for managing smaller elements, such as mobile navigation as well as cart & modal appearances. I have also used React Swipeable library to implement swiping between slides on mobile devices. Cart is also saved within local storage.

## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add and remove items from the cart.
- Update quantity of the cart items.
- View the cart's content.
- Open a modal gallery carousel by clicking on the large product image and interact with it.
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail image.
- Interact with mobile gallery by tapping the arrow buttons or swiping right or left.
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

In addition to this:

- Cart is stored within local storage.
- Users can swipe between slides on mobile devices.
